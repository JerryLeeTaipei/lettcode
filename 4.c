/*
The Median is the "middle" of a sorted list of numbers.
To find the Median, place the numbers in value order and find the middle.
BUT, with an even amount of numbers , we find the middle pair of numbers, and then find the value that is half way between them.

3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 40, 56

the middle numbers are 21 and 23, the Median is 22.
